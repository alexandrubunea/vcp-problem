# VCP Problem solving using GA and DPSO
The objective of the Vertex Cover Problem is to find the smallest possible vertex cover for a given graph. This is known as the Minimum Vertex Cover Problem.

## GA
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection, where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction to produce the offspring of the next generation. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover, and selection.

## DPSO
Differential Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) is a variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm that incorporates elements from Differential Evolution (DE). This hybrid approach aims to combine the strengths of both methods to improve performance on optimization problems.

## How to run?
Open the main file in Jupyter Notebook and you will get the hook of it.

## Required to run:
- Networkx
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- PrettyTable
- Scipy (required for generating a graph with many vertices)
